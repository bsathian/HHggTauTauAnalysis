### Instructions to run jupyter notebook on UAF

1. Follow these instructions [here](https://github.com/aminnj/scouting/blob/master/analysis/README.md) posted by Nick. 
2. Install `coffea` by running `pip install uproot4 coffea` (since Nick does not use coffea) after activating (`conda activate analysisenv`) the analysis environment
3. Start jupyter notebook inside the analysis directory by running `jupyter notebook --no-browser`, set up port forwarding (explained in Nick's README), and go to `localhost:1234` to open the notebook remotely
